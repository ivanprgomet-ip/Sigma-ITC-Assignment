With the assistance of the .NET framework, I have developed a simple WEB API SERVER APPLICATION and a MVC WEB CLIENT APPLICATION.
The WEB API uses an XML file (that was provided to me by Sigma ITC together with this assignment) to serve upp data about books to potential client and consumer applications.
The MVC CLIENT that is included in this project lets users search for books in different ways:
	- by book id
	- by book title


How to:
1. Download ZIP file of my project, un-zip it and open the solution in Visual Studio. 
2. Run the application (Ctrl + F5) with Google Chrome as a pre-selected web browser
3. You should see two input-fields together with two buttons and a empty gridview for data-result. 
4. In the input fields you can write whatever you want. If you want to populate the gridview I recommend you for an example to write "Ruby" in the "Search by title" - field and you can write "B2" in the "Get by ID" - field.
