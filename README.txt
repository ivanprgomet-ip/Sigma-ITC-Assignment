INFO:
With the assistance of the .NET framework, I have developed a simple WEB API SERVER APPLICATION and MVC CLIENT APPLICATION.
The WEB API uses an XML file (that was provided to me by Sigma ITC together with this assignment) to serve upp data to potential client applications to consume.
The xml file provided contains data about books, and the MVC CLIENT that is included in this project lets users search for books by book id and by book title in different ways through the graphical interface.



HOW TO USE:
1. Download ZIP file for the project, un-zip and open the solution in the latest Visual Studio Editor.
2. Before running the application, set the BooksWebAPI.Client project as Startup project, if its not already done by default.
3. Run the application (Ctrl + F5) with Google Chrome set as the pre-selected web browser
4. On the displayed page you should be able to see a Search section consisting of two search boxes and a Results section where the retrieved results will be. 
5. Try to search for a book by entering in B2 in the first search box and you should get the book with the id of B5. You can also try to search book(s) by title in the second search box by entering for example "Ruby"



ASSESMENT OF REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY:
* Transparency
	No comments added to code. Might be some xml class summaries, but not to explain something otherwise unclear.
	Time and effort put into correct naming convention of variables and methods.
* Resonable
	Modern and eminent teqniques were used in the development of the web api and the mvc client programs.
* Usable
	Client and api classes can easily be replaced due to the interface usage. 
* Exemplary
	Both the web api project and the mvc project implement good design pattern principles such as "the repository pattern" and "dependency injection".
